<h3> <p> Magic and Ritual in Post Colonial Mexico: A Fight to Impose Social Cohesion</p> </h3>

<p> MAP GOES HERE </p>

<p> In order critically understand the importance of witchcraft in society, this projects employs a transatlantic lens between Africa, Mexico, and the Caribbean in order to understand how witchcraft is instrumented as a tool of social power or certain demographics’ aims.  The issue of witchcraft in Mexico, while heavily influenced by European traditions, was tinged with the reality of colonial power and race relations. Like Europe, witchcraft had an othering effect, largely used as a device to differentiate between elites, non-elites, religious individuals, pagans, etc. In the colonial world, this type of othering occurred in along the times of race, power and knowledge. While Spanish elites defined magic in terms of their desire to impose power over indigenous people and African slaves, magic was also used between Indians and African slaves that came into close contact.</p>

<p> This information showcases that the apparatus and historical linkages (genealogy) play a large role in the manner in which magic is melded and used. Witchcraft signified a great deal in this region. The purpose of this map is to illustrate how magic served as a convergence point for differing cultures and helped colonial entities differentiate between colonized people and those they deemed inferior, such as women, mulattos, blacks, and Indians. </p>
    
<h3>Witchcraft as a method of gaining social cohesion</h3>

<p> MAP GOES HERE </p>

<p>The Spanish were concerned with persecuting Indians and African slaves who they perceived as magical or participating in rituals. The green stars on the map notate this. It was a way of othering the Indians, perceived as weak, and African slaves and those with African blood but also mixed with Spanish blood (mulatto). While torture was not common in the new world (43), inquisition was. The Spanish associated Indians with the devil, and this manifested out of the idea that the Spanish needed to supervise Indians (142, 49). As a result, Indian rebellion and rejection of this association was common (142, 108).  Blacks were also seen as witches and devils, but this broke with the European tradition of venerating certain dark skin saints and other symbols of the church (134, 148). Shows separation of certain European trends for the aim of colonial power being executed (148-149).  Some Spanish claimed that they learned witchcraft from Indians, thus bring forth arguments as magic as a genealogical artifact passed down and transmitted (133). </p>

<p>Women in colonial Mexico were also and issue for Spanish men. In one case, a woman was knocked to the floor because she did not make a Spaniards midday meal. Witchcraft was associated with laziness among women. Men did not regard women well who withheld food or other things from them because they believed it was a ploy to have them linked to the women. If they were weak then they would be unable to have sex with other women or do their duties (64-65, 110)
Herbs and other natural remedies were also used for love potions (120). One case was Catalina the druggist, the women known to make things. The Spanish collected confessions from people (131, 120, 124, 127). </p>

<h3> Witchcraft among Indians and Africans/Mulattos </h3>

<p> MAP GOES HERE</p>

<p> Witchcraft was also practiced between individuals on the lowered end of the caste system, which featured Spaniards at the top, mulattos, Indians, and then Africans at the bottom. Within these exchanges, it becomes unclear whether magic was used to further social cohesion. Instead, magic was a manner of gaining and rearranging power.  Hechiceria were witches who were used to reverse magic and brujeria cast magic (210?). When one was to be cured, they had to believe in the magic that was being used to cure them and accept the cure (125).</p>

<p> During the time of colonization, the Spanish kept records of their opinions and appraisals of magic. However, colonized peoples were able to testify back. Secondhand stories also depicted witchcraft that occurred beyond the bounds of a courtroom or logged incident (logged by Spaniards). Magic was also perpetrated amongst Africans and Indians who came into close contact on a large basis due to their social standing at the bottom of the caste system (149).
Lucas Olola, an African of supposed Yoruba heritage (Nigeria), was well known for using magic amongst the Indians. He would dress up in Indian feather and clothing, dance around, and then faint. His practices were melded with Africanism as well.  It is not clear if he was a swindler or a part of their society and gained their awe in a genuine way. He convinced the Indians to let him have his way with women, of which did not put up an argument according to sources (150, 153).
Witchcraft was often clumped by the Spaniards, but Indian, mulatto and black women who practices animal transfiguration (naguales) did not believe they were witches. According to certain confessions, women urged prosecutors to understand that they are not witches (153).</p>

<h3>However, imposed social order imposed even between colonial subjects</h3>

<p> MAP GOES HERE</p>

<p>During this time period, court documents show that a landed, free mulatto woman with African heritage was accused of witchcraft by an African woman travelling in the area. The free woman used the claim as a jumping board in which she could showcase that she was a proper colonial subject while the other was unruly and characteristically black. This inherent contradiction served as a means for those who physically stood at the bottom of the caste line but higher up in terms of economic stature, to delineate themselves from others they may be mistake for or grouped along with. It shows that progressions of power made in the colonial world were constantly subject to question. Witchcraft served as a way for these individuals to defend their mobility and acquisition of power. However, they were defining themselves in the terms of the Spanish in order to maintain this power. As a result, they reified the social cohesion set forth by Spanish rule.</p>
