        <h3> Final Project</h3>
        <p> In order to critically understand the importance of witchcraft in society and its transmission, this project employs a transatlantic lens between Africa, Mexico, and the Caribbean in order to understand how witchcraft is instrumented as a tool of social power. Looking to the spread and mixing of witchcraft beliefs as a spatial phenomenon, we employ cartography as a route of exploration.<br>
        You will first be presented with one video clip per section that orients you on the journey we took in our exploration.

<p> Witchcraft in its infinite and nebulous forms has existed on the continent of Africa much before Europeans began to more seriously study witchcraft in the late nineteenth century. Unfortunately, not much information exists about specific usage of witchcraft before this period. Therefore, we can only approach the study of magic and witchcraft from a time period in which we have concrete evidence. Through these specific examples of witchcraft, this project hopes to shed light on the progression of thought related to African witchcraft and delineate those different viewpoints.</p>

<h3>Witchcraft and Accusation in 1890 Onitsha</h3>

<iframe width="500" height="410" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://harvardc.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/embedViewer.html?webmap=f47281846a7a42ec820e60e5ec1e3709&amp;extent=6.4867,5.9191,7.2447,6.4017&amp;zoom=true"></iframe><br />

<p>Bishop Samuel Crowther’s transcription of the confessions of Okunwan and Anorra provides a means from which to study the witchcraft of 1890 Onitsha. The voices of accused witches were not prominently featured in recorded colonial or mission documents, so these confessions provide a unique framework from which to study witchcraft’s role in their society as well as the role of self-accusation (Bastian, “Daughter” 87).  </p>

<p> In a typical self-accusation, the accused witch (almost always female) would reveal herself physically by stripping in the market place. This action represented her willingness to open herself up for public scrutiny, accepting the loss of both her humanity and her identity (Bastian, “Bloodhounds” 146). She would then proclaim her use of witchcraft and tell her story. This kind of performance was a demonstration of growing power, which would attract the attention of all who were at the market place. However, that power was taken away at the end of the confession when all would then stone her (Bastian, “Bloodhounds” 148).</p>

<p> On the other hand, the self-accused male sorcerer or witch handled his confession very differently: he would generally be on his deathbed when making his confession. Unlike the self-accused female witch, he would confess as a way of boasting about his conquests rather than either being forced to or out of guilt. (Bastian, “Bloodhounds”148)</p>

<p>Furthermore, the general model for accusation of another in Onitsha was slightly different. The victims of supposed witchcraft would consult diviners and relatives to find the source of the harm experienced. Once the source was located, the relative would then take the victim’s case to the elders of the town. This type of accusation might then be brought up to Eze Onicha, the King of Onitsha, who would administer <i>orachi</i> as a test to the accused. (Bastian, “Bloodhounds” 148)</p>

<h3>Implications  of Onitsha Witchcraft</h3>

<p>Accusation in both cases of coming from the self or another sheds light on the communal nature of witchcraft in the Onitsha society. Given the public nature of self-accusation, the eventual fate of the accused depended heavily upon the community’s perception of the confession. Therefore, in the case of the self-accused, the act of confession was not a passive act; it allowed the accused to frame the story heard. In the case of Okuwan, she was able to take control of the narrative and paint herself as a loyal servant who did not embrace witchcraft voluntarily. Not only was the content of her confession important, but also the way she expressed herself. The eloquence with which she delivered her confession indicated a specialized form of knowledge, inflating the people’s perception of her, which all gave her more credibility and authority (Bastian, “Bloodhounds” 152). Her being expelled from the community, and escaping death, indicates how witchcraft played an intricate role in the Onitsha community in 1890 in terms of social politics and ideas of power and identity.</p>

<h3>European Interpretations of Witchcraft in Africa</h3>

<iframe width="500" height="410" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://harvardc.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/embedViewer.html?webmap=f47281846a7a42ec820e60e5ec1e3709&amp;extent=-34.4429,-2.4841,62.5884,51.1092&amp;zoom=true"></iframe><br />

<p>Although the accounts of witchcraft like the above-mentioned case of the Onitsha people suggest the complex role of witchcraft in society, many early-nineteenth century European anthropologists and sociologists approached witchcraft from a European perspective. For example, French philosopher Lucien Levy-Bruhl’s ideas of the “primitive mind” and “pre-logical thinking” heavily influenced nineteenth century European thought. Anthropologists tended to interpret the existence of witchcraft as evidence supporting these claims of primitive society. This kind of social evolutionary thinking made strong assumptions about unilinear progress from “primitive” to “modern,” creating the notion of the “primitive other” (Moore and Sanders 2). As interactions with African communities revealed a lack of definitive societies and geographic boundaries, this notion of the “primitive” seemed to become more engrained.</p>

<p>However, the work of E.E. Evans-Pritchard began to change the European narrative. Having spent time with the Azande, Evans-Pritchard published work saying witchcraft was not a signal of irrational thought (Moore and Sanders 6). He discovered that witchcraft pervaded every aspect of Azande life, affecting their relationships between themselves and with their environment (Evans-Pritchard 19). By taking a cultural and symbolic approach to the study of witchcraft, Evans-Pritchard made the sociology of knowledge and systems of thought his main focus; he was concerned not with the why, but with the how (Moore and Sanders 6). On the most basic level, magic existed for the Azande because it explained the inexplicable, providing answers for the ever-changing world in which they lived. </p>

<p>The shift to a social rather than metaphysical perspective of witchcraft led to a structural-functionalist view of witchcraft in Africa. Anthropologists began to look at accusation patterns of witchcraft and linked them to the process of fission in the society as African communities came into more contact with the West in terms of new forms of consumption and production (Moore and Sanders 9). This focus on the philosophical purpose of witchcraft as a catalyst for action and change in the community marked a change away from a general overemphasis on the negative power and malevolent forces of witchcraft. (Moore and Sanders 2)</p>

<h3>Contemporary Witchcraft as a Social Tool</h3>

<p> However, the structural-functionalist view fell out of favor soon as such a view began to link increases in witchcraft with the negative effects of colonialism, migration and Christianity (Moore and Sanders 8). Instead, those studying witchcraft in modernity now look at how witchcraft plays an important part in the people’s ideas of production and consumption and ultimately their transition into “modernity.” With the increasing differentiation in social and political structures and even geographical boundaries, contemporary witchcraft practices are now being studied from these ever changing lenses (Moore and Sanders 17). </p>

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/94109765" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


<iframe width="500" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://harvardc.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/embedViewer.html?webmap=2ca9b8032f494408a0b356ad173c8ecf&amp;extent=-120.677,-31.1528,50.8855,53.0503&amp;zoom=true&amp;scale=true"></iframe><br />

<p> The exact origins of voodoo in the Caribbean can be traced to the general regions occupied by Benin and Nigeria today. Beginning in the 1500s and onward, slaves were brought to the Caribbean where their spiritualistic beliefs mingled with Catholicism to give birth to Vodun, or Voodoo. </p>

<h3>Zora Neil Hurston, Tell My Horse </h3>
<p>As Zora Neil Hurston explains in her book, <i>Tell My Horse</i>, Voodoo is something considered to be as old as existence itself for a practitioner. For an example of the actual practice of Voodoo, the <i>Mambo </i>, or priestess, performs a ritual where she removes her veils and clothing until she falls naked and spiritually intoxicated to the ground (Hurston, 112-13). The ceremony continues as the males participating kiss her genitals, a sign of reverence for having been shown the ultimate truth: that there is no mystery beyond the source of life. </p>

<p>Hurston argues that the pantheon of Haitian Voodoo is not simply the re-appropriation of Catholic saints or African deities but that the Haitian gods, <i>myteres</i>, or <i>loas</i> are something unique (Hurston, 114).  There are two types of gods: the Rada, who are associated with “good”, and the <i>Petro</i>, who are considered “bad”. No one individual can name all of the <i>loa</i> because each region in Haiti has its own variation of the pantheon. The preeminent <i>loas</i> include: <i>Papa Legba</i><i>, the m</i>ediator for humans wishing to contact other <i>loas</i>, <i>Erzulie</i>, a syncretic deity analogous to the Virgin Mary, <i>Baron Samedi</i>, lord of the graveyard, and <i>Damballa</i>, the bringer of rain, the source for all other members of the Haitian pantheon and leader of the Rada (Birchfield and Gray, 328).</p>

<p><i>Damballa</i> is associated with of snakes and is often represented by the image of Saint Patrick (Hurston, 116). The only semblance to the Irish saint is the presence of the snakes. Hurston mentions that all throughout Haiti, <i>Damballa</i> is considered to be Moses, who was also represented by a serpent. The link originates from the reverent and supernatural tales of Moses in the Bible. In one of these tales, Moses throws down the rod of Aaron which becomes a snake and engulfs the snake-rods of the court magicians. The origins of <i>Damballa</i> is entrenched in the past, much like many religions we have seen in class, as a form of legitimization. To the practitioner, Voodoo is something inherited from the mysticism present in the past while for the scholar it is the syncretism of French Catholicism and African spiritualism. The snake is revered because it is considered to be the servant of <i>Damballa</i> (Hurston, 117). All throughout the shrines, Hurston notes various images of snakes. <i>Damballa</i>, is not the father of all the gods but instead, he oversees them and no action can be performed by another god without his approval. </p>

<h3>Encyclopedia of Voodoo</h3>

<p>In Africa, Vodun posits the existence of a, called <i>Bon Dieu </i>. The majority of the ceremonial actions of Vodun involve praise to the <i>loa</i>, spirits associated with objects, ideas, and phenomena. Almost all of the modern day <i>loa</i> are associated with a Roman Catholic saint. Various practitioners of Voodoo also identify themselves as Roman Catholics and do not view the two systems as opposite. Scholars have debated whether during the time of slavery, African and their descendants used elements of Catholicism to mask African practices from the disapproving eye of their masters (Balderston, Gonzalez and López, 1572). Other elements of Vodun incorporate symbols and ideas from the Free Masons. </p>

<p>The practice of Vodun has a special category known as <i>guédés </i>, which are the beings associated with the dead. There is a fundamental schism in Vodun: the <i>Rada</i> and <i>Petro</i>. <i>Rada</i> is a term derived from the city of Allada and used to describe the Fon people. The <i>loa</i> derived from the Fon spiritualism are called <i>Rada</i>. The new spirits from the Caribbean receive the category of <i>Petro</i>. While some of the <i>Petro loa </i>are derived from individuals in Haiti’s slave revolution, in general the <i>Rada</i> are often associated with good magic while the malevolent magic, although there are exceptions. </p>

<h3>Vodun means spirit in the Fon language. </h3>

<p>An interest in African diasporic religions has been growing recently as mentioned in <i>The Green Egg</i>, a neopagan magazine (Lewis, xliii). Lewis mentions that Vodun is a mixture of the Fon system of veneration of the spirits came in contact with other African religious traditions and French Catholicism, to produce what we call Vodun. It has spread via emigration to New Orleans and major cities in the United States, most notably New York City. </p>

<p>One example of the effects of Vodun is Santería. In the early nineteenth century, the Yoruba were enslaved and sent to Cuba and Brazil, where Yoruba-speaking communities formed. New initiates were made in these communities and were dedicated to the Yoruba spirits, called orishas. In Spanish, orishas are santos (literally, “saints”). This led the people to call the Yoruba traditions in Cuba Santería, “the way of the saints.” Since the Cuban revolution of 1959, over one million Cubans have come to the United States, many of them Priests and Priestesses of Santeria.</p>

<p>The imperfect nature of the human condition is a common motif to almost all African religions. The typical creation myth will assert the immortality of the ancestors which was stripped away through some act of disobedience (typically by a woman, such as for the Dinka of southern Sudan, and the Nuer, who live near the Dinka, as well as the Ganda of central Uganda) or an animal. The creation myths assert the human condition may be improved through rituals, although there is never an explicit promise of personal salvation in the afterlife. Instead, African religions promise to bring salvation into this world and assume that, while humans are responsible for the misfortune that befalls society, they have the power to rectify this. A priest is the mediator in African religions, for he can identify the problem and appeal to the gods for a solution. African religions frequently contain supreme gods, considered often to be myths, which are encounters through spiritual possession. On the other hand lesser spirits and ancestors are more involved in the quotidian life of a practitioner. </p>

<h3> <p> Magic and Ritual in Post Colonial Mexico: A Fight to Impose Social Cohesion</p> </h3>

<p> In order critically understand the importance of witchcraft in society, this projects employs a transatlantic lens between Africa, Mexico, and the Caribbean in order to understand how witchcraft is instrumented as a tool of social power or certain demographics’ aims.  The issue of witchcraft in Mexico, while heavily influenced by European traditions, was tinged with the reality of colonial power and race relations. Like Europe, witchcraft had an othering effect, largely used as a device to differentiate between elites, non-elites, religious individuals, pagans, etc. In the colonial world, this type of othering occurred in along the times of race, power and knowledge. While Spanish elites defined magic in terms of their desire to impose power over indigenous people and African slaves, magic was also used between Indians and African slaves that came into close contact.</p>

<p> This information showcases that the apparatus and historical linkages (genealogy) play a large role in the manner in which magic is melded and used. Witchcraft signified a great deal in this region. The purpose of this map is to illustrate how magic served as a convergence point for differing cultures and helped colonial entities differentiate between colonized people and those they deemed inferior, such as women, mulattos, blacks, and Indians. </p>
    
<h3>Witchcraft as a method of gaining social cohesion</h3>

<p>The Spanish were concerned with persecuting Indians and African slaves who they perceived as magical or participating in rituals. The green stars on the map notate this. It was a way of othering the Indians, perceived as weak, and African slaves and those with African blood but also mixed with Spanish blood (mulatto). While torture was not common in the new world (43), inquisition was. The Spanish associated Indians with the devil, and this manifested out of the idea that the Spanish needed to supervise Indians (142, 49). As a result, Indian rebellion and rejection of this association was common (142, 108).  Blacks were also seen as witches and devils, but this broke with the European tradition of venerating certain dark skin saints and other symbols of the church (134, 148). Shows separation of certain European trends for the aim of colonial power being executed (148-149).  Some Spanish claimed that they learned witchcraft from Indians, thus bring forth arguments as magic as a genealogical artifact passed down and transmitted (133). </p>

<p>Women in colonial Mexico were also and issue for Spanish men. In one case, a woman was knocked to the floor because she did not make a Spaniards midday meal. Witchcraft was associated with laziness among women. Men did not regard women well who withheld food or other things from them because they believed it was a ploy to have them linked to the women. If they were weak then they would be unable to have sex with other women or do their duties (64-65, 110)
Herbs and other natural remedies were also used for love potions (120). One case was Catalina the druggist, the women known to make things. The Spanish collected confessions from people (131, 120, 124, 127). </p>

<h3> Witchcraft among Indians and Africans/Mulattos </h3>

<p> Witchcraft was also practiced between individuals on the lowered end of the caste system, which featured Spaniards at the top, mulattos, Indians, and then Africans at the bottom. Within these exchanges, it becomes unclear whether magic was used to further social cohesion. Instead, magic was a manner of gaining and rearranging power.  Hechiceria were witches who were used to reverse magic and brujeria cast magic (210?). When one was to be cured, they had to believe in the magic that was being used to cure them and accept the cure (125).</p>

<p> During the time of colonization, the Spanish kept records of their opinions and appraisals of magic. However, colonized peoples were able to testify back. Secondhand stories also depicted witchcraft that occurred beyond the bounds of a courtroom or logged incident (logged by Spaniards). Magic was also perpetrated amongst Africans and Indians who came into close contact on a large basis due to their social standing at the bottom of the caste system (149).
Lucas Olola, an African of supposed Yoruba heritage (Nigeria), was well known for using magic amongst the Indians. He would dress up in Indian feather and clothing, dance around, and then faint. His practices were melded with Africanism as well.  It is not clear if he was a swindler or a part of their society and gained their awe in a genuine way. He convinced the Indians to let him have his way with women, of which did not put up an argument according to sources (150, 153).
Witchcraft was often clumped by the Spaniards, but Indian, mulatto and black women who practices animal transfiguration (naguales) did not believe they were witches. According to certain confessions, women urged prosecutors to understand that they are not witches (153).</p>

<h3>However, imposed social order imposed even between colonial subjects</h3>

<p>During this time period, court documents show that a landed, free mulatto woman with African heritage was accused of witchcraft by an African woman travelling in the area. The free woman used the claim as a jumping board in which she could showcase that she was a proper colonial subject while the other was unruly and characteristically black. This inherent contradiction served as a means for those who physically stood at the bottom of the caste line but higher up in terms of economic stature, to delineate themselves from others they may be mistake for or grouped along with. It shows that progressions of power made in the colonial world were constantly subject to question. Witchcraft served as a way for these individuals to defend their mobility and acquisition of power. However, they were defining themselves in the terms of the Spanish in order to maintain this power. As a result, they reified the social cohesion set forth by Spanish rule.</p>
