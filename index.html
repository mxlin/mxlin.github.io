        <h2>FM106: History of Witchcraft and Charm Magic</h2>
        <h3> Final Project</h3>
        <p> In order to critically understand the importance of witchcraft in society and its transmission, this project employs a transatlantic lens between Africa, Mexico, and the Caribbean in order to understand how witchcraft is instrumented as a tool of social power. Looking to the spread and mixing of witchcraft beliefs as a spatial phenomenon, we employ cartography as a route of exploration.<br>
        You will first be presented with one video clip per section that orients you on the journey we took in our exploration.

<p> Witchcraft in its infinite and nebulous forms has existed on the continent of Africa much before Europeans began to more seriously study witchcraft in the late nineteenth century. Unfortunately, information about witchcraft before the nineteenth century is scarce. Therefore, we approach the study of magic and witchcraft in Africa in 1890, a time period from which we have concrete evidence. Through this specific example of witchcraft, this project hopes to shed light on the progression of thought related to African witchcraft and delineate changing viewpoints.</p>

<h3>Witchcraft and Accusation in 1890 Onitsha</h3>

<iframe width="500" height="410" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://harvardc.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/embedViewer.html?webmap=f47281846a7a42ec820e60e5ec1e3709&amp;extent=6.4867,5.9191,7.2447,6.4017&amp;zoom=true"></iframe><br />

<p>Bishop Samuel Crowther’s transcription of the confessions of Okunwan and Anorra provides a means from which to study the witchcraft of 1890 Onitsha. The voices of accused witches were not prominently featured in recorded colonial or mission documents, so these confessions provide a unique framework from which to study witchcraft’s role in their society as well as the role of self-accusation (Bastian, “Daughter” 87).  </p>

<p> In a typical self-accusation, the accused witch (almost always female) would reveal herself physically by stripping in the market place. This action represented her willingness to open herself up for public scrutiny, accepting the loss of both her humanity and her identity (Bastian, “Bloodhounds” 146). She would then proclaim her use of witchcraft and tell her story. This kind of performance was a demonstration of growing power, which would attract the attention of all who were at the market place. However, that power was taken away at the end of the confession when all would then stone her (Bastian, “Bloodhounds” 148).</p>

<p> On the other hand, the self-accused male sorcerer or witch handled his confession very differently: he would generally be on his deathbed when making his confession. Unlike the self-accused female witch, he would confess as a way of boasting about his conquests rather than either being forced to or out of guilt. (Bastian, “Bloodhounds”148)</p>

<p>Furthermore, the general model for accusation of another in Onitsha was slightly different. The victims of supposed witchcraft would consult diviners and relatives to find the source of the harm experienced. Once the source was located, the relative would then take the victim’s case to the elders of the town. This type of accusation might then be brought up to Eze Onicha, the King of Onitsha, who would administer <i>orachi</i> as a test to the accused. (Bastian, “Bloodhounds” 148)</p>

<h3>Implications  of Onitsha Witchcraft</h3>

<p>Accusation in both cases of coming from the self or another sheds light on the communal nature of witchcraft in the Onitsha society. Given the public nature of self-accusation, the eventual fate of the accused depended heavily upon the community’s perception of the confession. Therefore, in the case of the self-accused, the act of confession was not a passive act; it allowed the accused to frame the story heard. In the case of Okuwan, she was able to take control of the narrative and paint herself as a loyal servant who did not embrace witchcraft voluntarily. Not only was the content of her confession important, but also the way she expressed herself. The eloquence with which she delivered her confession indicated a specialized form of knowledge, inflating the people’s perception of her, which all gave her more credibility and authority (Bastian, “Bloodhounds” 152). Her being expelled from the community, and escaping death, indicates how witchcraft played an intricate role in the Onitsha community in 1890 in terms of social politics and ideas of power and identity.</p>

<h3>European Interpretations of Witchcraft in Africa</h3>

<iframe width="500" height="410" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://harvardc.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/embedViewer.html?webmap=f47281846a7a42ec820e60e5ec1e3709&amp;extent=-34.4429,-2.4841,62.5884,51.1092&amp;zoom=true"></iframe><br />

<p>Although the accounts of witchcraft like the above-mentioned case of the Onitsha people suggest the complex role of witchcraft in society, many early-nineteenth century European anthropologists and sociologists approached witchcraft from a European perspective. For example, French philosopher Lucien Levy-Bruhl’s ideas of the “primitive mind” and “pre-logical thinking” heavily influenced nineteenth century European thought. Anthropologists tended to interpret the existence of witchcraft as evidence supporting these claims of primitive society. This kind of social evolutionary thinking made strong assumptions about unilinear progress from “primitive” to “modern,” creating the notion of the “primitive other” (Moore and Sanders 2). As interactions with African communities revealed a lack of definitive societies and geographic boundaries, this notion of the “primitive” seemed to become more engrained.</p>

<p>However, the work of E.E. Evans-Pritchard began to change the European narrative. Having spent time with the Azande, Evans-Pritchard published work saying witchcraft was not a signal of irrational thought (Moore and Sanders 6). He discovered that witchcraft pervaded every aspect of Azande life, affecting their relationships between themselves and with their environment (Evans-Pritchard 19). By taking a cultural and symbolic approach to the study of witchcraft, Evans-Pritchard made the sociology of knowledge and systems of thought his main focus; he was concerned not with the why, but with the how (Moore and Sanders 6). On the most basic level, magic existed for the Azande because it explained the inexplicable, providing answers for the ever-changing world in which they lived. </p>

<p>The shift to a social rather than metaphysical perspective of witchcraft led to a structural-functionalist view of witchcraft in Africa. Anthropologists began to look at accusation patterns of witchcraft and linked them to the process of fission in the society as African communities came into more contact with the West in terms of new forms of consumption and production (Moore and Sanders 9). This focus on the philosophical purpose of witchcraft as a catalyst for action and change in the community marked a change away from a general overemphasis on the negative power and malevolent forces of witchcraft. (Moore and Sanders 2)</p>

<h3>Contemporary Witchcraft as a Social Tool</h3>

<p> However, the structural-functionalist view fell out of favor soon as such a view began to link increases in witchcraft with the negative effects of colonialism, migration and Christianity (Moore and Sanders 8). Instead, those studying witchcraft in modernity now look at how witchcraft plays an important part in the people’s ideas of production and consumption and ultimately their transition into “modernity.” With the increasing differentiation in social and political structures and even geographical boundaries, contemporary witchcraft practices are now being studied from these ever changing lenses (Moore and Sanders 17). </p>

<h3>The Spread of African Religion Motifs: A New Religious Landscape for the New World</h3>

<p>After 1500s slaves were brought to the new world through the slave trade. Their previous belief systems were not completely eradicated by the Church and this facilitated the melding of beliefs in the new world. Some common motifs are:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The imperfect nature of the humans
 <ul>
  <li>The typical creation myth will assert the immortality of the ancestors which was stripped away through some act of disobedience typically by a woman or an animal. The creation myths assert the human condition may be improved through rituals, although there is never an explicit promise of personal salvation in the afterlife. </li>
  <li>Instead, African religions promise to bring salvation into this world and assume that, while humans are responsible for the misfortune that befalls society, they have the power to rectify this. </li>
 </ul></li>
 <li>Gods among us
 <ul>
  <li>Supreme gods (those who rule over nature) are often considered to be myths which are encountered through spiritual possession. Supreme gods rarely interfere with the everyday activities of worshippers. On the other spectrum, lesser spirits and ancestors are more involved in the quotidian life of a practitioner. </li>
  <li>The interference of these lesser spirits is through possession. Animal sacrifice is often carried out as a ritual because the blood of a victim is thought to contain potent spiritual forces to motivate the lesser sprits to act.</li>
 </ul></li>
 <li>Dynamic Religions 
 <ul>
  <li>Religious ideas frequently travel across ethnic and political boundaries in Africa. A few African religions have been imported to the America’s and follow this trend of syncretism that forms a unique religious landscape in the new world. </li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Voodoo: The Melding of African Spiritualism, Roman Catholicism, and the Haitian Condition</h3>

<p>The traditions of Caribbean religions in the wake of European colonization show how people fashioned a system of belief from the forceful interactions of traditions and practices due to slavery. The new religious systems were persecuted and outlawed by colonizers for their challenge on Christianity.  </p>

<h3> <p> Magic and Ritual in Post Colonial Mexico: A Fight to Impose Social Cohesion</p> </h3>

<p>In order critically understand the importance of witchcraft in society, this projects employs a transatlantic lens between Africa, Mexico, and the Caribbean in order to understand how witchcraft is instrumented as a tool of social power or certain demographics’ aims.</p>

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/94110113" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The issue of witchcraft in Mexico, while heavily influenced by European traditions, was tinged with the reality of colonial power and race relations. Like Europe, witchcraft had an othering effect, largely used as a device to differentiate between elites, non-elites, religious individuals, pagans, etc. In the colonial world, this type of othering occurred in along the times of race, power and knowledge. While Spanish elites defined magic in terms of their desire to impose power over indigenous people and African slaves, magic was also used between Indians and African slaves that came into close contact.</p>

<p>This information showcases that the apparatus and historical linkages (genealogy) play a large role in the manner in which magic is melded and used. Witchcraft signified a great deal in this region. The purpose of this map is to illustrate how magic served as a convergence point for differing cultures and helped colonial entities differentiate between colonized people and those they deemed inferior, such as women, mulattos, blacks, and Indians. </p>

<p>Encountering the area with 200 men in 1519, Hernando Cortes arrived in present-day Mexico. By 1522, he conquered the area with the help of native allies. As time pressed onward to the 17th century, native populations were decimated due to European diseases and widespread violence. Most natives were forced into serfdom, but the Spanish found them weak and unable to do a wide range of work. Looking for slave populations to replace the natives, the Spanish began importing slaves. In the process of attempting to solve for labor problems by including African slave populations, colonial society became infused with a wide range of cultural backgrounds. While the Spanish attempted to make order of this diversity through the caste system, they could not thoroughly control the manner in which ritual practices were transmitted and intertwined. Looking to the map above, you will find pins that discuss the manner in which native populations and African slaves used magic amidst the Spanish who processed confessions and accusations of witchcraft.  </p>

<p>Please look at the map in the following order: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Yellow flags refer to the convergence of African and native rituals. </li>
 <li>The red arrow has information pertaining to the incidence of magic deemed to be good and bad within Mesoamerica.</li>
 <li>•	Green stars refer to confessions and uses of natural magic. Within these cases, the Spanish used such to impose normative values over natives and women. Through these instances, it can be seen that women were SENTENCE NOT FINISHED</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, these points convey the manner in which European entities have sought social cohesion through the manner in which they view magic as disruptive to society and colonial norms. </p>

<p>Key themes: <br>
<u> Witchcraft as a method of gaining social cohesion </u> <br>
The Spanish were concerned with persecuting Indians and African slaves who they perceived as magical or participating in rituals. The green stars on the map notate this. It was a way of othering the Indians, perceived as weak, and African slaves and those with African blood but also of mixed ancestry (Mulattos). While torture was not common in the new world (Lewis 43), inquisition was used to expose the occurrence of magic. This connects to the lecture in which we learned that witch-hunts were not common in Spain or Italy in the late 16th and 17th centuries and instead popular in France, Germany, and other northern countries (Lecture 12).</p>
<p>In colonial Mexico, witchcraft accusations and confessions became arenas in which men communicated their expectations of women. When women were lazy or men lost control of their productivity, they were accused of witchcraft. Additionally, slaves and natives were viewed as devils and capable of magic.</p>
<p>In one case, magic ironically served to reify the colonial caste system. In one instance, a free, mulatto woman named Adrianna was accused of witchcraft by a African, runaway. In order to distance herself from this woman, Adriana showcased that she was a good colonial subject because she took her slaves to church and ran her estate under good influence. While she attempted to teach persecutors that all individuals with African blood were not diabolic or capable of witchcraft, she reified the status quo that slaves and natives out to aim for colonial norms imposed by the Spanish (Lewis 1-3). </p>
<p> <u>Witchcraft as a convergence of Indian and African cultures</u><br>
Witchcraft occurred beyond the bounds of courtrooms or inquisitions. Documents showcase the interactions between African and native rituals. These occurrences can be found within the yellow flags in the map and the red arrow. They showcase the unpredictability of magic in this circumstance. Expanding our worldview of magic, these instances highlight the manner in which magic was improvised and set within the context of one’s social standing.
</p>
<p>Such improvisation of witchcraft and ritual was common to the area. Lucas Olola, an African of supposed Yoruba heritage (Nigeria), was well known for using native and African magic amongst the Indians. His example, featured in the leftmost yellow flag above, showcases the degree of uncertainty within these exchanges. It is not clear if he was a swindler or had genuinely sought to incorporate himself into the upper rungs of native society with his impromptu use of magic and domination. </p>
<p><u>Witchcraft’s Utility and Constant Evaluation</u><br>
Progressions of power made in the colonial world were constantly subject to question. Witchcraft accusations served as a way for the Spanish to defend their mobility and acquisition of power. It also helped them distance themselves from natives and Africans who were deemed as inherently capable of magic. </p>
<p>	While this is the case, the Spanish delineated between acceptable and improper magic. Looking to the traditions of brujeria and hechicería, it becomes clear that certain magical forms were useful because of their anti-witchcraft or healing properties. As a result, certain form of African ritual and magic featured in hechicería were perpetuated by the Spanish authorities largely because it helped them achieve social cohesion: a society in which magical curses and negative consequences did not inhibit productivity and colonial norms. </p>
<p><u>The Catholic Church</u><br>
Lastly, it is important to note the influence of the Catholic Church in this region. While conversions were encouraged amongst native and African populations in order to purge Mesoamerica of idolatry, native and African religious practices became syncretic. Individuals began intermingling their rituals with Catholicism instead of only seeking to practice uniform Catholicism (Lauer 84-85).  Practices such as nagaulism (animal transfiguration) were incorporated into the religious practices of natives who also practiced Catholicism. One may speculate that this could only have happened because natives took the pains to tell Spanish inquisitors that nagualism was not the same as witchcraft, but served other ritual purposes, such as linking one to the earth, spying on people, and more (Lewis). </p>
